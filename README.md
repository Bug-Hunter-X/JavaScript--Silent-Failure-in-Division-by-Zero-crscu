# JavaScript: Silent Failure in Division by Zero

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in JavaScript: silent failure due to division by zero. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.

The original code has a flaw in its error handling. It attempts to handle division by zero, but instead of explicitly raising an error or using a more robust method (such as checking for zero before the division), it silently returns 0 which may mask more serious problems.

The solution improves the handling of division by zero by explicitly throwing an error, enhancing the code's robustness and preventing unexpected results.
